# Terraform_AWS
IaC with Terraform

On my terraform learning Journey.
I use Terraform to code couples of architectures and deploy them on AWS.
I will try to add a image of the infrastructure I'm trying to deploy.

1. Stand alone web server (Linux)
2. A VPC, two subnets, SGs, NACL, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, Instances in each subnet
3. 
4. Why not try to code and deploy the KodeKloud infrastructure (That's will be the ultimate challenge but I'm not there yet)
